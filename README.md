## Problem Statement

This comprehensive dashboard offers a detailed analysis of Blinkit's key performance indicators, providing valuable insights into sales, customer satisfaction, product categories, and outlet-specific metrics. By leveraging Power BI, I created a visually engaging and interactive dashboard that effectively communicates these insights.

The "Outlet Establishment" chart shows the growth of outlets over time. The "Fat Content" chart analyzes the popularity of low-fat and regular products. The "Item Visibility" metric provides insights into the visibility of different items. By providing these insights and recommendations, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize Blinkit's operations for continuedÂ success.

# KPI Requirements

1. Total Sales : The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2. Average Sales : The average revenue per sale.
3. Number of Items : The total count of different items sold.
4. Average Rating : The average customer rating for items sold.
