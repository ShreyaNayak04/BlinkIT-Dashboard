## Problem Statement

This comprehensive dashboard offers a detailed analysis of Blinkit's key performance indicators, providing valuable insights into sales, customer satisfaction, product categories, and outlet-specific metrics. By leveraging Power BI, I created a visually engaging and interactive dashboard that effectively communicates these insights.

The "Outlet Establishment" chart shows the growth of outlets over time. The "Fat Content" chart analyzes the popularity of low-fat and regular products. The "Item Visibility" metric provides insights into the visibility of different items. By providing these insights and recommendations, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and optimize Blinkit's operations for continuedÂ success.
